'''
The enumerate function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to loop over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and get the index and value of each element in the sequence at the same time. Here's a basic example of how it works:
'''

# Loop over a list and print the index and value of each element
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)


# Loop over a list and print the index (starting at 1) and value of each element
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(index, fruit)


fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f'{index+1}: {fruit}')

# Loop over a tuple and print the index and value of each element
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print(index, color)


# Loop over a string and print the index and value of each character
s = 'hello'
for index, c in enumerate(s):
    print(index, c)
